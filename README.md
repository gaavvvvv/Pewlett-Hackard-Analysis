# Overview
For this challenge I was tasked with sorting all upcoming retirees by their titles and also filtering which current employees would be eligible for mentorship, which would allow them to fill some of the positions left by the new retirees at Pewlett-Hackard. All this data would be used to help future proof Pewlett-Hackard's plans for their staffing needs. All this was done in postgres/PGAdmin.

I started with six csv files which were given to me. Using SQL and postgres, I created nine additional tables and csv files that help illustrate the data that was requested

# Results
- Many employees at Pewlett-Hackard are retiring
- Senior Engineers (29414), Senior Staff (28254), Engineers (14222), and Staff (12243) make up most of the retirees leaving a huge gap in PH's workforce
- There are only 1550 employees who are eligible for mentorship

# Summary
- With PH losing so many employees they need to ramp up their mentorship program/training and their hiring efforts
